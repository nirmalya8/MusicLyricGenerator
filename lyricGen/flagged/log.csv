'Look','Look 
 Take me back of my door 
 I''ll be sick inside if baby you''d be my cure 
 Boy, you got me like a shot to my heart 
 But the church at the car 
 So came the new 
 I''d say my really damn heart? 
 Why him would I never blind about the tears I cried 
 All the sleepless nights or the endless fights 
 I never talked about the days he called 
 There was something wrong, it rains to oh, all no black out 
 Broadway''s Electric people in life are free
