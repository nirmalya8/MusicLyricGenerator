Can I go where you go? 
 Can we always be this close? 
 Forever and ever, ah 
 Take me out, and take me home 
 You're my, my, my, my lover 
 Ooh, look what you made me do 
 Look what you made me do 
 Look what you just made me do 
 Look what you just made me— 
 Ooh, look what you made me do 
 Look what you made me do 
 Look what you just made me do 
 Look what you just made me do 
 So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh 
 You need to calm down, you're being too loud 
 And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh) 
 You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown? 
 You need to calm down 
 In the middle of the night, in my dreams 
 You should see the things we do, baby 
 In the middle of the night, in my dreams 
 I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time 
 Are you ready for it? 
 So it's gonna be forever 
 Or it's gonna go down in flames 
 You can tell me when it's over, mm 
 If the high was worth the pain 
 Got a long list of ex-lovers 
 They'll tell you I'm insane 
 'Cause you know I love the players 
 And you love the game 
 'Cause we're young and we're reckless 
 We'll take this way too far 
 It'll leave you breathless, hmm 
 Or with a nasty scar 
 Got a long list of ex-lovers 
 They'll tell you I'm insane 
 But I've got a blank space, baby 
 And I'll write your name 
 But I knew you 
 Dancin' in your Levi's 
 Drunk under a streetlight, I 
 I knew you 
 Hand under my sweatshirt 
 Baby, kiss it better, I 
 But we were something, don't you think so? 
 Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool 
 And if my wishes came true 
 It would've been you 
 In my defense, I have none 
 For never leaving well enough alone 
 But it would've been fun 
 If you would've been the one 
 (Ooh) 
 My baby's fit like a daydream 
 Walking with his head down 
 I'm the one he's walking to 
 So call it what you want, yeah 
 Call it what you want to 
 My baby's fly like a jet stream 
 High above the whole scene 
 Loves me like I'm brand new 
 So call it what you want, yeah 
 Call it what you want to 
 Is it cool that I said all that? 
 Is it chill that you're in my head? 
 'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate) 
 Is it cool that I said all that? 
 Is it too soon to do this yet? 
 'Cause I know that it's delicate 
 Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? 
 Isn't it? 
 Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? 
 Isn't it... delicate? 
 And it's new, the shape of your body 
 It's blue, the feeling I've got 
 And it's ooh, whoa oh 
 It's a cruel summer 
 It's cool, that's what I tell 'em 
 No rules in breakable heaven 
 But ooh, whoa oh 
 It's a cruel summer 
 With you 
 You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye 
 And I got that red lip classic thing that you like 
 And when we go crashing down, we come back every time 
 'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style 
 You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt 
 And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt 
 And when we go crashing down, we come back every time 
 'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style 
 But if I just showed up at your party 
 Would you have me? Would you want me? 
 Would you tell me to go fuck myself 
 Or lead me to the garden? 
 In the garden, would you trust me 
 If I told you it was just a summer thing? 
 I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything 
 But I know I miss you 
 You're so gorgeous 
 I can't say anything to your face 
 'Cause look at your face 
 And I'm so furious 
 At you for making me feel this way 
 But what can I say? 
 You're gorgeous 
 But I can see us lost in the memory 
 August slipped away into a moment in time 
 'Cause it was never mine 
 And I can see us twisted in bedsheets 
 August sipped away like a bottle of wine 
 'Cause you were never mine 
 I’m so sick of running as fast as I can 
 Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man 
 And I'm so sick of them coming at me again 
 'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man 
 I'd be the man 
 I'd be the man 
 Don't blame me, love made me crazy 
 If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right 
 Lord, save me, my drug is my baby 
 I'll be usin' for the rest of my life 
 They say I did something bad 
 Then why's it feel so good? 
 They say I did something bad 
 But why's it feel so good? 
 Most fun I ever had 
 And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could 
 It just felt so good, good 
 I didn't have it in myself to go with grace 
 And you're the hero flying around, saving face 
 And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake? 
 Cursing my name, wishing I stayed 
 Look at how my tears ricochet 
 Say my name and everything just stops 
 I don't want you like a best friend 
 Only bought this dress so you could take it off 
 Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah 
 Carve your name into my bedpost 
 ’Cause I don't want you like a best friend 
 Only bought this dress so you could take it off 
 Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah 
 And they said 
 There goes the last great American dynasty 
 Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been 
 There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen 
 She had a marvelous time ruining everything 
 I've been the archer, I've been the prey 
 Who could ever leave me, darling 
 But who could stay? 
 ’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood 
 You know it used to be mad love 
 So take a look what you've done 
 ’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey! 
 Now we've got problems 
 And I don't think we can solve 'em 
 You made a really deep cut 
 And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey! 
 Time, curious time 
 Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs 
 Were there clues I didn't see? 
 And isn't it just so pretty to think 
 All along there was some 
 Invisible string 
 Tying you to me? 
 Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh 
 It's you and me, that's my whole world 
 They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay) 
 The whole school is rolling fake dice 
 You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes 
 It's you and me, there's nothing like this 
 Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay) 
 We're so sad, we paint the town blue 
 Voted most likely to run away with you 
 You were drivin' the getaway car 
 We were flyin’, but we'd never get far 
 Don't pretend it's such a mystery 
 Think about the place where you first met me 
 Ridin' in a getaway car 
 There were sirens in the beat of your heart 
 Should've known I'd be the first to leave 
 Think about the place where you first met me 
 In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh 
 No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh 
 No, nothing good starts in a getaway car 
 You know I love a London boy 
 I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon 
 He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet 
 Darling, I fancy you 
 Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates 
 So I guess all the rumors are true 
 You know I love a London boy 
 Boy, I fancy you (Ooh) 
 And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends 
 I'd never walk Cornelia Street again 
 That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend 
 I'd never walk Cornelia Street again 
 And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name 
 And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away 
 I'd never walk Cornelia Street again 
 I'd never walk Cornelia Street again 
 And that's the thing about illicit affairs 
 And clandestine meetings and longing stares 
 It's born from just one single glance 
 But it dies and it dies and it dies 
 A million little times 
 Sweet tea in the summer 
 Cross your heart, won't tell no other 
 And though I can’t recall your face 
 I still got love for you 
 Your braids like a pattern 
 Love you to the Moon and to Saturn 
 Passed down like folk songs 
 The love lasts so long 
 And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for 
 King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa 
 And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go 
 King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa 
 I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you 
 I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you 
 I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night 
 And now I see daylight, I only see daylight 
 I forgot that you existed 
 And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't 
 And it was so nice 
 So peaceful and quiet 
 I forgot that you existed 
 It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference 
 I forgot that you 
 Say you'll remember me 
 Standing in a nice dress 
 Staring at the sunset, babe 
 Red lips and rosy cheeks 
 Say you'll see me again 
 Even if it's just in your 
 Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa 
 Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa 
 I just wanted you to know that this is me trying 
 I just wanted you to know that this is me trying 
 Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts 
 Flashbacks waking me up 
 I get drunk, but it's not enough 
 ’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby 
 I look through the windows of this love 
 Even though we boarded them up 
 Chandelier's still flickering here 
 ’Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not 
 It's death by a thousand cuts 
 And there's nothing like a mad woman 
 What a shame she went mad 
 No one likes a mad woman 
 You made her like that 
 And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out 
 And you find something to wrap your noose around 
 And there's nothing like a mad woman 
 And all the pieces fall right into place 
 Getting caught up in a moment 
 Lipstick on your face 
 So it goes… 
 I'm yours to keep 
 And I'm yours to lose 
 You know I'm not a bad girl, but I 
 Do bad things with you 
 So it goes… 
 I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings 
 Uh huh, that's right 
 Darling, you're the one I want, and 
 I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this 
 Uh huh, that's right 
 Darling, you're the one I want 
 In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams 
 Oh, you're the one I want 
 This is why we can't have nice things, darling 
 Because you break them 
 I had to take them away 
 This is why we can't have nice things, honey (Oh) 
 Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me? 
 This is why we can't have nice things 
 Hush, when no one is around, my dear 
 You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes 
 Spinning in my highest heels, love 
 Shining just for you 
 Hush, I know they said the end is near 
 But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes 
 Spinning in my highest heels, love 
 Shining just for you 
 But we might just get away with it 
 Religion's in your lips 
 Even if it's a false god 
 We'd still worship 
 We might just get away with it 
 The altar is my hips 
 Even if it's a false god 
 We'd still worship this love 
 We’d still worship this love 
 We’d still worship this love 
 He got my heartbeat 
 Skipping down 16th Avenue 
 I got that, ah, I mean 
 Wanna see what's under that attitude like 
 I want you, bless my soul 
 And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows 
 I think he knows 
 But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm 
 If your cascade, ocean wave blues come 
 All these people think love's for show 
 But I would die for you in secret 
 The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me 
 Would it be enough if I could never give you peace? 
 Hey, it's all me, in my head 
 I'm the one who burned us down 
 But it's not what I meant 
 Sorry that I hurt you 
 I don't wanna do, I don’t wanna do this to you (Ooh) 
 I don’t wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh) 
 I need to say, hey, it’s all me, just don't go 
 Meet me in the afterglow 
 But we were dancing 
 Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied 
 Yeah, we were dancing 
 Like it was the first time, first time 
 Yeah, we were dancing 
 Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied 
 Yeah, we were dancing 
 And I had a bad feeling 
 But we were dancing 
 Stood on the cliffside screaming, "Give me a reason" 
 Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in 
 Don't want no other shade of blue but you 
 No other sadness in the world would do 
 With you I serve, with you I fall down, down 
 Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out 
 'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play 
 And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate 
 Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake 
 I shake it off, I shake it off 
 Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break 
 And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake 
 Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake 
 I shake it off, I shake it off 
 Rain came pouring down 
 When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe 
 And by morning 
 Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean 
 (Oh, oh, oh, oh) 
 It's nice to have a friend (Ooh) 
 It's nice to have a friend (Ooh) 
 Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? 
 Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods? 
 Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? 
 Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good 
 Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? 
 Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods? 
 Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? 
 Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good 
 (Are we out of the woods?) 
 If you could see that I'm the one who understands you 
 Been here all along, so why can't you see? 
 You belong with me, you belong with me 
 'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in 
 So, shame on me now 
 Flew me to places I'd never been 
 'Til you put me down, oh 
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in 
 So, shame on me now 
 Flew me to places I'd never been 
 Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground 
 Oh, oh-oh 
 Trouble, trouble, trouble 
 Oh, oh-oh 
 Trouble, trouble, trouble 
 'Cause baby, I could build a castle 
 Out of all the bricks they threw at me 
 And every day is like a battle 
 But every night with us is like a dream 
 Baby, we're the new romantics 
 Come on, come along with me 
 Heartbreak is the national anthem 
 We sing it proudly 
 We are too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet 
 Baby, we're the new romantics 
 The best people in life are free 
 We are never, ever, ever getting back together 
 We are never, ever, ever getting back together 
 You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me 
 But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together 
 Like, ever 
 I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22 
 Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you 
 You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to 
 Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 
 22, 22 
 We found Wonderland 
 You and I got lost in it 
 And we pretended it could last forever (ey, ey) 
 We found Wonderland 
 You and I got lost in it 
 And life was never worse but never better (ey, ey) 
 (Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey) 
 In Wonderland 
 (Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey) 
 In Wonderland 
 (Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey) 
 In Wonderland 
 (Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey) 
 In Wonderland 
 You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence), you 
 You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home), you 
 You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out) 
 You are in love, true love 
 You are in love 
 (Stay!) Hey 
 All you had to do was stay 
 Had me in the palm of your hand 
 Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in? 
 (Stay!) Hey 
 Now, you say you want it back 
 Now that it's just too late 
 Well, could've been easy 
 All you had to do was (Stay!) 
 All you had to do was (Stay!) 
 All you had to do was (Stay!) 
 All you had to do was (Stay!) 
 All you had to do was stay 
 And I never saw you coming 
 And I’ll never be the same 
 Baby, I know places we won't be found 
 And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down 
 'Cause I, I know places we can hide 
 I know places, I know places 
 Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone 
 Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? 
 The girl in the dress cried the whole way home 
 I shoulda known 
 Losing him was blue like I'd never known 
 Missing him was dark grey, all alone 
 Forgetting him was like 
 Trying to know somebody you never met 
 But loving him was red 
 Loving him was red 
 Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you 
 Welcome to New York, welcome to New York 
 Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you 
 Welcome to New York, welcome to New York 
 It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore 
 The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me 
 Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you 
 Welcome to New York, welcome to New York 
 This night is sparkling 
 Don't you let it go 
 I'm wonderstruck 
 Blushing all the way home 
 I'll spend forever 
 Wondering if you knew 
 I was enchanted to meet you 
 I want you for worse or for better 
 I would wait forever and ever 
 Broke your heart, I'll put it back together 
 I would wait forever and ever 
 And that's how it works 
 That's how you get the girl, girl (Oh-oh, oh) 
 And that's how it works 
 That's how you get the girl, girl 
 But now I'll go sit on the floor 
 Wearing your clothes 
 All that I know is 
 I don't know how to be something you miss 
 I never thought we'd have a last kiss 
 Never imagined we'd end like this 
 Your name, forever the name on my lips 
 And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid 
 I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did 
 I've been spending the last eight months 
 Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end 
 But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again 
 Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water? 
 You put your arm around me for the first time 
 You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter 
 You are the best thing that's ever been mine 
 So this is me swallowing my pride 
 Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night 
 And I'd go back to December all the time 
 It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you 
 Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine 
 And darling, it was good 
 Never looking down 
 And right there where we stood 
 Was holy ground 
 Someday, I'll be living in a big old city 
 And all you're ever gonna be is mean 
 Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me 
 And all you're ever gonna be is mean 
 Why you gotta be so mean? 
 Long live the walls we crashed through 
 All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you 
 I was screaming, long live all the magic we made 
 And bring on all the pretenders 
 One day, we will be remembered 
 And it was like slow motion 
 Standing there in my party dress 
 In red lipstick 
 With no one to impress 
 And they're all laughing 
 As I'm looking around the room 
 But there was one thing missing 
 And that was the moment I knew 
 He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar 
 The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star 
 He's the song in the car 
 I keep singing, don't know why I do... 
 We had a beautiful magic love there 
 What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair 
 'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you 
 You're gonna believe them 
 And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out 
 Well, count to ten, take it in 
 This is life before you know who you're gonna be 
 Fifteen 
 Drop everything now 
 Meet me in the pouring rain 
 Kiss me on the sidewalk 
 Take away the pain 
 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile 
 Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down 
 Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around 
 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile 
 It's alright, just wait and see 
 Your string of lights is still bright to me 
 Oh, who you are is not where you've been 
 You're still an innocent 
 You're still an innocent 
 She's not a saint and she's not what you think 
 She's an actress, whoa 
 She's better known for the things that she does 
 On the mattress, whoa 
 Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys 
 On the playground won't make you many friends 
 She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind 
 There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha! 
 And I just want to tell you 
 It takes everything in me not to call you 
 And I wish I could run to you 
 And I hope you know that 
 Every time I don’t 
 I almost do, I almost do 
 Our song is the slamming screen door 
 Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window 
 When we're on the phone and you talk real slow 
 'Cause it's late and your mama don't know 
 Our song is the way you laugh 
 The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have" 
 And when I got home 'fore I said amen 
 Asking God if he could play it again 
 That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale 
 I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell 
 This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town 
 I was a dreamer before you went and let me down 
 Now it's too late for you and your white horse 
 To come around 
 And I don't know how it gets better than this 
 You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless 
 And I don't know why but with you I'd dance 
 In a storm in my best dress, fearless 
 Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room 
 And we're not speaking 
 And I'm dying to know 
 Is it killing you like it's killing me? 
 Yeah, I don't know what to say 
 Since the twist of fate when it all broke down 
 And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now 
 Next chapter 
 I said, "Oh, my, what a marvelous tune" 
 It was the best night, never would forget how we moved 
 The whole place was dressed to the nines 
 And we were dancing, dancing 
 Like we're made of starlight 
 Like we're made of starlight 
 And I can't breathe without you, but I have to 
 Breathe without you but I have to 
 And this is when the feeling sinks in 
 I don't wanna miss you like this 
 Come back, be here, come back, be here 
 I guess you're in New York today 
 I don't wanna need you this way 
 Come back, be here, come back, be here 
 Come on, come on, don't leave me like this 
 I thought I had you figured out 
 Something's gone terribly wrong 
 You're all I wanted 
 Come on, come on, don't leave me like this 
 I thought I had you figured out 
 Can't breathe whenever you're gone 
 Can't turn back now, I'm haunted 
 So don't you worry your pretty little mind 
 People throw rocks at things that shine 
 And life makes love look hard 
 The stakes are high, the water's rough 
 But this love is ours 
 And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called 
 And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all 
 And you flashback to when he said forever and always 
 Oh, and it rains in your bedroom 
 Everything is wrong 
 It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 
 'Cause I was there when you said forever and always 
 Don't say yes, run away now 
 I'll meet you when you're out 
 Of the church at the back door 
 Don't wait or say a single vow 
 You need to hear me out 
 And they said "speak now" 
 But when you think Tim McGraw 
 I hope you think my favorite song 
 The one we danced to all night long 
 The moon like a spotlight on the lake 
 When you think happiness 
 I hope you think that little black dress 
 Think of my head on your chest 
 And my old faded blue jeans 
 When you think Tim McGraw 
 I hope you think of me 
 Oh darling, don't you ever grow up 
 Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little 
 Oh darling, don't you ever grow up 
 Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple 
 I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart 
 And no one will desert you 
 Just try to never grow up, never grow up 
 And I used to be on your side 
 Now it's looking like we're going to battle 
 And why you're taking shots at me like 
 Somebody's gonna give you a medal? 
 And I never wanna hurt you 
 But I'm tired of taking all these blows 
 And so I'd rather be on your side 
 But if you wanna fight 
 Baby let's go, oh, oh 
 Let's go, oh, oh 
 Ahh-ahh-ahh 
 Hey, say that you remember 
 Ai, ai, dancin' in September 
 Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day 
 But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
 And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name 
 You're so in love that you act insane 
 And that's the way I loved you 
 Breaking down and coming undone 
 It's a roller coaster kind of rush 
 And I never knew I could feel that much 
 And that's the way I loved you 
 You should've said, "No" 
 You should've gone home 
 You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go 
 You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d 
 Get back to me (Get back to me) 
 And I should've been there, in the back of your mind 
 I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?" 
 You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet 
 You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me 
 'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel 
 Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so 
 Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you 
 Can't help it if there's no one else 
 Mmm, I can't help myself 
 I don't know why all the trees change in the fall 
 But I know you're not scared of anything at all 
 Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away 
 But I know I had the best day with you today 
 Come back, come back, come back to me like 
 You would, you would if this was a movie 
 Stand in the rain outside till I came out 
 Come back, come back, come back to me like 
 You could, you could if you just said you're sorry 
 I know that we could work it out somehow 
 But if this was a movie you'd be here by now 
 You don't have to call anymore 
 I won't pick up the phone 
 This is the last straw 
 Don't wanna hurt anymore 
 And you can tell me that you're sorry 
 But I don't believe you baby like I did before 
 You're not sorry (No no no no) 
 In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream 
 It's like a million little stars spelling out your name 
 You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together 
 Come on, come on, little taste of heaven 
 Because these things will change 
 Can you feel it now? 
 These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down 
 This revolution, the time will come 
 For us to finally win 
 And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah 
 Oh, oh 
 Take me back to the house in the backyard tree 
 Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me 
 You never did, you never did 
 Take me back when our world was one block wide 
 I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried 
 Just two kids, you and I 
 Oh my my my my 
 I watch superman fly away 
 You've got a busy day today 
 Go save the world, I'll be around 
 I watch superman fly away 
 Come back, I'll be with you someday 
 I'll be right here on the ground 
 When you come back down 
 I'm sick and tired of your attitude 
 I'm feeling like I don't know you 
 You tell me that you love me, then cut me down 
 And I need you like a heartbeat 
 But you know you got a mean streak 
 That makes me run for cover when you're around 
 And here's to you and your temper 
 Yes, I remember what you said last night 
 And I know, that you see, what you're doing to me 
 Tell me why 
 You're beautiful 
 Every little piece, love 
 And don't you know 
 You're really gonna be someone 
 Ask anyone 
 And when you find everything you looked for 
 I hope your life will lead you back to my door 
 Oh, but if it don't 
 Stay beautiful 
 Whoa oh, I'm feeling you baby 
 Don't be afraid to 
 Jump then fall 
 Jump then fall into me 
 Baby, I'm never going to leave you 
 Say that you want to be with me too 
 So I'ma stay through it all 
 So jump then fall 
 I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned 
 Held out, held on 
 God knows, too long, you wasted my time 
 Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here 
 No amount of freedom gets you clean 
 I still got you all over me 
 Drop everything now 
 Meet me in the pouring rain 
 Kiss me on the sidewalk 
 Take away the pain 
 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile 
 Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down 
 Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around 
 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile 
 I just want to show you 
 She don't even know you 
 She's never going to love you like I want to 
 And you just see right through me 
 But if you only knew me 
 We could be a beautiful 
 Miracle 
 Unbelievable 
 Instead of just invisible 
 So how can I ever try to be better? 
 Nobody ever lets me in 
 I can still see you, this ain't the best view 
 On the outside looking in 
 I've been a lot of lonely places 
 I've never been on the outside 
 I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you 
 To stand outside my window throwing pebbles 
 Screaming, "I'm in love with you" 
 Wait there in the pouring rain 
 Come back for more 
 And don't you leave 'cause I know 
 All I need is on the other side of the door 
 I’ll leave my window open 
 ‘Cause I’m too tired at night to call your name 
 Just know I’m right here hoping 
 That you’ll come in with the rain 
 So dim that spotlight, tell me things like 
 I can't take my eyes off of you 
 I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl 
 Who's desperately in love with you 
 Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar 
 I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know 
 I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on 
 Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world 
 Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart? 
 Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now? 
 Why would you wanna make the very first scar? 
 Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart? 
 Last Christmas I gave you my heart 
 But the very next day, you gave it away 
 This year, to save me from tears 
 I will give it to someone special 
 Baby, this is what you came for 
 Lightning strikes every time she moves 
 And everybody's watching her 
 But she's looking at you, oh, oh 
 You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh 
 You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh 
 You, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Didn't she call you 
 Didn't she need you bad enough 
 Was there some reason 
 I'm not aware of 
 Did you not write it down 
 Just one more thing to do 
 Where were you 
 And didn't she pray too 
 I didn't bring her up so they could cut her down	8	None

 Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong 
 It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 
 I was there when you said "forever and always" 
 So here you are at my window 
 Guess nobody told you 
 I don’t need don’t need you 
 And I waited so frustrated 
 Who’s gonna hold you 
 I don’t need you don’t need you now 
 And I could tell you his favorite color's green 
 He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth 
 His sister's beautiful, he has his father’s eyes 
 And if you asked me if I love him 
 I’d lie 
 Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me 
 I have been an awful good girl, Santa baby 
 So hurry down the chimney tonight 
 Don't you look in my eyes 
 I might fall in love 
 With a beautiful boy 
 I wish that I could touch 
 You go I hope you think of me 
 As the stars fall down and the heavens fade 
 This girl is begging wait for me 
 X is the shape I drew through your face 
 In permanent marker 
 Oh, yeah 
 Just like the mark you knew you were making 
 Who do you think you are? 
 To write on his heart in 
 Permanent marker 
 And by the way your eyes are dancing 
 I'd say the chances of that are getting slim 
 By the way my heart's still breaking 
 It's going to take it a while to love again 
 So many things that I forgot to say 
 By the way 
 He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar 
 The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star 
 He's the song in the car I keep singing 
 Don't know why I do 
 Tell me 
 You’ll never leave me 
 And I’m not crazy and 
 This is really happening 
 That this is really happening 
 Oh, oh 
 We were babies, we were beautiful and free 
 Oh, oh 
 There was nothing that was out of reach 
 For me and Britney 
 But here I am, an open book 
 Turn the page, it’s all the rage 
 Get a look on the inside 
 Oh, what you get is what you see 
 Baby, you hold the key 
 To the diary of me 
 I'd be a stranger in an all night diner 
 Waiting for a love to find her 
 Lonely like a harbor light 
 That's never seen a boat 
 Like a line in an old love letter 
 No one ever wrote 
 Will my love come in a bowl of fire? 
 Will it be filled with hope and desire? 
 Will my love come in a pouring rain? 
 Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain 
 Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love 
 So why the hell don't you love me? 
 Why the hell don't you need me like I need you? 
 Why you so far above me? 
 Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do? 
 But I was just a toy, which you destroyed 
 Stupid boy 
 I know this shouldn't be a lonely time 
 But there were Christmases when you were mine 
 I could be your favorite blue jeans 
 With the holes in the knees 
 In the bottom of the top drawer 
 I could be your little beauty queen 
 Just a little outta reach 
 Or the girl living next door 
 I'll be your angel giving up her wings 
 If that's what you need 
 I'd give everything to be your anything 
 Ooh, life's so sweet right here 
 Ooh, keeping it young and crazy 
 Ooh, just want to stay right here 
 Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby 
 So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack 
 Got myself a big country serving of payback 
 I guess I'm gonna have to listen to my mama's "I told you so" 
 But you ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack 
 It would take Brad Pitt to leave you 
 It takes five seconds to need you 
 When I'm mad at all the lovebirds 
 'Cause they don't know to play our song 
 I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you 
 I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me 
 'Cause that's where you belong 
 Until Brad Pitt comes along 
 All my friends are saying 
 Girl, what are you thinking? 
 You're better off 
 You're better off without him 
 Find yourself another 
 Girl, that boy is trouble 
 You're better off, you're better off 
 They can talk forever, they just don't know better 
 I can't wait for the day I stop pretending 
 That I'm really OK when I'm not 
 I want to know how it feels to be 
 Over you for real 
 Until I do 
 I'll keep writing songs about you 
 There's a whole a lot of good people in heaven 
 And I don't wanna get there too soon 
 And I know there's a God because I met him 
 And I see it when I'm looking at you 
 There ain't no accidents in what we do 
 My name's Heather 
 Guess we're on the same flight 
 Don't mind Gracie 
 She could talk to you all night 
 She's finally well enough to travel 
 Doctor says she's in the clear 
 She's been in and out of hospital 
 Since the beginning of the year 
 If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind? 
 Would it be a million miles of cold white lies 
 And unfamiliar exit signs? 
 I just drive on by, just south of knowing why 
 If you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon 
 And maybe this will be enough 
 I'd like to keep you til I'm old, but if I can't, at least you'll know 
 That, baby, perfect have I loved 
 He says 'I love you' and 'I really care about you' 
 When, he says he'll hold me in his arms when I'm afraid 
 When, I'll say, oh, I'll say I love him too 
 And, I care about you, yeah, this ain't no charade 
 Then he'll drive me home listenin' to the radio 
 And, he says he really loves me too, he'll do anything 
 Don't walk away now 
 And don't rip my heart out 
 Don't you block me out tonight 
 Honey where are you? 
 And don't hate me for loving you 
 Firefly you drew me to you 
 Your beauty shines and lights up the sky 
 And you don't know it, do you? 
 I wish I could keep you firefly 
 Firefly 
 Once you're gone I know your memory'll 
 Somehow get the best of me 
 So I question everything I do 
 Unsure of turning you away 
 Wondering love how I’ll act today 
 Until you find somebody new 
 So I’ve been holding on 
 Way too long 
 But not another minute 
 I'm gonna miss you bad but 
 Can’t call it love if you ain’t in it 
 If you leave I'll be crawling back for more 
 If you need love I'll be standing at your door 
 I'll be sick inside if baby you'd be my cure 
 Boy, you got me like a shot to the heart 
 Got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car 
 Caught a red light I ran right through 
 Gotta call my friends, tell them all about you 
 Always looking like one of those nights 
 When you're thinkin' 'bout kissing 'til the morning light 
 You got me, you do 
 Well I guess I wished on a plane 
 I thought it was a star 
 I guess what you wrote on paper 
 Wasn't written on your heart 
 Could've sworn you said you loved me 
 I guess I heard you wrong 
 And I guess I wished on a plane 
 That I thought was a star 
 And that small town daydream 
 Lasted all night 
 'Cause tonight all those bright city lights 
 Just look at you look at me 
 Heaven looked down to see 
 We're falling now 
 And there's nothing we ain't too sure of 
 Just two kids making up for lost love 
 And it was a long time coming 
 I waited half my life just to find someone like you 
 I spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out 
 Not knowing it'd be a long time going 
 I never talked about the tears I cried 
 All the sleepless nights or the endless fights 
 I never talked about the days he called 
 There was something wrong, it was all my fault 
 I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now 
 But in case you haven't heard the news 
 There wasn't much love to lose 
 Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you I love you 
 Ooh, ooh, ooh, come a little closer 
 Oh, oh, I love you I love you 
 And I'm down to my last breath 
 Trying to get my heels back under my head 
 They say I’ve always known 
 What I wanted 
 My friends and enemies 
 Will tell you it’s true 
 You will find out 
 I always get it 
 I know what I want 
 And it ain’t you 
 Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side 
 Bye, bye, baby 
 I want you back but it's coming down to nothing 
 And all you have is to walk away 
 From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah 
 Down came the rain 
 Lightning and thunder 
 We tried in vain 
 To hold on to each other 
 Winds of change blew you away from me 
 Right here right now, I feel it on my skin 
 The bitter sting of what we could’ve been 
 Just when our love was like a burning flame 
 Down came the rain 
 So I cross my heart and hope for you 
 Knock on wood and rope the moon 
 I’ll pray for you and me and hope I’m right 
 And I wait around that old wishing well 
 You never know if time will tell 
 I cross my heart and hope for you tonight 
 You and me 
 Baby this is what we do 
 I may see 
 There are people you just come back to 
 So fall back on me 
 Fall back on you 
 Angels fly, in the air tonight 
 Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake? 
 Stars collide in the air so light 
 Or was it just like those promises that you made? On our last night 
 I said, that's when I wake up in the morning 
 That's when after sun is always storming 
 Laughing when I'm crying 
 That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate 
 That's when never see your face 
 I let you in, baby that's when 
 Snap buttons on a denim shirt 
 Blue jeans and a little dirt 
 That’s the closest you’ll see me 
 Feet hanging out a pickup truck 
 Crazy and a little rough 
 Running free 
 That’s the closest to a cowboy 
 You’ll see me 
 Do you know when you go 
 You make the sweetest sight at the window 
 If you had never come out of the blue 
 I would have stayed up and Made Up You 
 And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train 
 See how far I can go 
 'Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain 
 And talk to someone I don't know 
 I will face the world around me 
 Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go 
 And I will fall in love again 
 Because I can 
 You should've said no, you should've gone home 
 You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go 
 You should have known the word 'bout what you did with her'd get back to me 
 And I should've been there in the back of your mind 
 I shouldn't be asking myself why 
 You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet 
 You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me 
 There's a girl that you want 
 She’s everything that I am not 
 And you can't stop thinking about her 
 There's a thin little line 
 And it’s like you cross it every time 
 When you can't stop thinking about her 
 And Now I 
 Can't walk straight 
 Can't talk straight 
 Can't think about anything but the way 
 It should be 
 It could be 
 And till you come 'round again I'll be 
 Doin' what I usually do 
 Thinkin' 'Bout you 
 Oh, ah 
 Like there's a fairytale guy 
 And he whispers sweet lullabies 
 And the music plays from nowhere 
 As we dance in the pale moonlight 
 With candles and fireflies all night 
 Everybody thinks about love 
 I want love they haven't thought of yet 
 You should turn Z93 on 
 Broadway's Electric Barnyard 
 I sing a song called "Tim McGraw" 
 Request it and they'll play it all day long 
 I sing in stations all day long 
 But there's nothing like when you're on 
 The Electric Barnyard 
 He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar 
 The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star 
 He's the song in the car 
 I keep singing, don't know why I do...
