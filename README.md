# Music Lyric Generator
## What is this project about?
---
This project is about generating meaningful lyrics from one or a few words. We have dealt with country music and rap music in this project. When the file `app.py` in either of `country_lyric` or `rap_lyric` is run, the corresponding user interface pops up, on which users can give their own input word, or can choose from a number of words given under the example section.  

## Warning
--- 
The lyrics generated by the Rap Lyric Generator might contain various slangs, something which is very prevalent in the lyrics of today. 


## Directory Structure
---
The `lyricGen` folder contains all the necessary source code from preprocessing data to building the modes and finally creating its deployment. The `country_lyric` folder consists of all the files for generating country music lyrics, taking inspiration from Taylor Swift's music. 

The `rap_lyric` folder has the source code for generating rap lyrics, taking inspiration from Kanye West's music. 

The names of the files are given on the basis of what task they are used for. For example, `data_preprocessing.py` is used for data processing. Similarly, `model.py` is used to create the model, which is trained using `train.py`.
